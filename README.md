## ERC809

This is a work in progress implementation of the ERC-809 standard for renting nonfungible ERC-721 tokens.

It uses a red black interval tree to prevent multiple people from using an asset at the same time.

The use case in mind here is real estate but I would like to make this broadbly applicable.

If you are working on something similar - contact me and let's collaborate
